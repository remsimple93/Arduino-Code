# Arduino-Code
This repo contains Arduino code (sketches) for reading from analog GPIO pins and logging the values to an SD card while also displaying them on an LCD.

Filename *Temp_LCD_datalogging* contains code for reading from a TMP36 temperature sensor, displaying the values on an LCD, and logging them to an microSD card module.

Filename *Pip_testbed* contains code for reading from multiple Arduino GPIO pins, voltage values from three sensors: 1) pH sensor, 2) DO sensor, and 3) TMP36 temperature sensor. Will display the values on an LCD and log them to a microSD card module.
